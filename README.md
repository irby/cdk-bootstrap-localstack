# CDK Bootstrap LocalStack

A small Docker image to help you bootstrap your Localstack CDK stack.

Please reference the [example docker compose file](./docker-compose.example.yaml) on how to use this Docker container in your workflow.

This is helpful for projects using Localstack free tier and using the AWS CDK to provision infrastructure. Helps lessen the overhead of the ephemeral environments so developers spend more time focusing on other things.
